# Scratchy
Scratchy is a Visual Studio extension that lets you create little notes in a handy tool window which you can dock wherever you like into your layout.

After installing the extension (to be published on the VS marketplace soon), open the window via **View** -> **Other Windows** -> **Scratchy**.  The contents of the scratchpad are saved per solution.  Don't put anything important in there obviously, but this at least means you can retain the notes per session so won't be lost if you need to restart your machine or VS or something.
